          <p>As much as I love biking in the snow... at night... while it's 2&#8457;, sometimes that's just not
             the best option. I personally invested in an indoor bike trainer that I can actually hook up my own beat up
             road bike to.

             It helps me get some extra miles in on days I'm busy or the conditions don't warrant, well, me risking my life
             for a bike ride. Cycling indoors can be tough with family and roommates though. Cost, noise, cooling and the
             the obscene amount of sweat the human body can produce often pose as common obstacles when it comes to indoor cycling.

             </p>
             <p>
             In the video above, you'll find a complete overview of my indoor set up (a.k.a 'The Pain Cave') addressing all these issues.
             If your curious about the noise these trainers can create, below I created a comparison of all noise levels between different
             popular trainers. If you're interested, check it out!
